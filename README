Welcome to the cyclophone project !
===================================

This art project is designed with many interactive component.
But this repository contains the code for a Teensy Arduino to send MIDI signals (for sounds and video) depending on the speed of a bike.
The speed is estimated with a dynamo connected to a diode bridge (because of the AC signal) and voltage divider (because we have a maximum of 25V instead of 5V).

Enjoy !
Jimmy & Drix, with the video master Hélène Ruiz and the sound master Santiago Guerrero.
